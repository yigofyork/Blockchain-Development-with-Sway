# Blockchain Development with Sway
It has its own virtual machine called FuelVM and is developed in conjunction with the programming language "Sway". Sway is a Rust-based programming language used to develop smart contracts, and its design was inspired by Rust and Solidity.


The Fuel runtime environment does not officially support Windows. If you are a Windows user, you can start developing Fuel tools by installing them in the WSL environment.
